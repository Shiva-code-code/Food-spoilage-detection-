## <a name="Overview"> Overview</a>
Food spoilage detection is a crucial aspect of food safety and preservation. This Arduino-based solution offers a simple yet effective method to monitor the freshness of food items using analog sensors. By comparing sensor readings to a baseline value, the system can detect changes indicative of spoilage and provide timely alerts to users.

Features
Real-time monitoring of food freshness using analog sensors
Automatic baseline adjustment for accurate detection
Visual and auditory feedback to indicate food status (fresh or spoiled)
Easy to understand web interface for monitoring sensor data
Integration with LCD display for local status indication
Hardware Requirements
Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
Analog sensor (e.g., MQ-4 gas sensor for detecting food spoilage)
LCD display (optional, for local status indication)
Buzzer (optional, for auditory feedback)
Breadboard and jumper wires
Power source (e.g., USB cable, battery pack)
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
Required libraries (e.g., LiquidCrystal for LCD, ESPAsyncWebServer for web interface)
